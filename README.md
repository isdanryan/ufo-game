# **Javascript UFO Game**



## **Site Overview**
Based on the hidden game within Google's "no internet connection" window, this version is just as simple and just as addictive. Featuring a UFO that you need to guide through an asteroid field, it makes a great simple game to play while taking a break from more concentrated tasks.
